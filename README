This is a directory that contains all code and raw data (or directions to storage location for raw data) for published figures in Roach, Shepherd, Mickelson et al. Code to reproduce figures is at `scripts/NHBE paper code.Rmd`. A knitted version of the code and subsequent figures is at `scripts/NHBE paper code.html`. Some of the raw data needs to be downloaded from FigShare (see below, figures 1B, 3C, and 3D).

Additionally, the directory `invert/` contains the code needed to analyze Influenza replication kinetics. The RNAseq reads for this experiment are deposited on NCBI under PRJXXXX. It outputs the raw data needed for making figure 3D. 

Figure 1 data:
- 1A bar plot, 1C-1H: Data is located under `data/pre_and_post_infection_phenotyping_data.csv`. 
- 1B: Flow cytometry channel value files need to be downloaded from FigShare at www.xxxx.com into the `data/round_7_channel_value_files` folder. Metadata is located at `figure_1_metadata.csv`.

Figure 2 data:
- 2A UMAP: The data for this is the same as figure 2B. 
- 2B,F: Data for alluvial plots are located at `data/nhbe_alluvial_plot_data.xlsx`. 
- 2C: Data is same as figure 1A,C-H. 
- 2D: Data is located at `data/sialic_acid_log_gmfi_values.csv`.
- 2E: Data available by request.

Figure 3 data:
- 3A,B: Data available by request.
- 3C: FI values need to be downloaded from FigShare at www.xxxx.com into the `data/influenza_fluorescence_intensity` folder. Metadata is located at `data/figure_3c_metadata`.
- 3D: Raw fastq files for re-running InVERT are available on SRA at XXXX. The InVERT output used to create the correlation graph is at `data/invert_data`. Metadata is located at `data/figure_3d_metadata.csv`.

Figure 4 data:
- 4A: Data available by request.
- 4B,C: Data is located at `data/nhbe_burst_size_data.csv`
